Treat everyone with respect. Build on each other's ideas. Each of us has the right to enjoy our experience and participate without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or subtle.

* Harassing comments
* Intimidation
* Encouraging a person to engage in self-harm
* Sustained disruption or derailing of threads, channels, lists, and similar forums
* Offensive or violent comments, jokes, or otherwise
* Inappropriate sexual content
* Unwelcome sexual or otherwise aggressive attention
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Distribution or threat of distribution of people's personally identifying information, also known as “doxing”

## Consequences for failing to comply with this policy

Consequences for failing to comply with this policy may include any of the following, at the sole discretion of the Fuchsia community managers:

* A request for an apology
* A private or public warning or reprimand
* A temporary ban from the members of the project.
